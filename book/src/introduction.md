# Introduction

*Get familiar with HoloEasy.*

## What is HoloEasy

HoloEasy is an open-source library for creating holograms in Minecraft that uses [ProtocolLib](https://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib) (or [PacketEvents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents)) to handle packets. 
This allows for greater performance as the server does not have to manage these entities.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why?
- HoloEasy only uses packets instead of registering the entity in the actual Minecraft server.


#### Do I need Kotlin with HoloEasy?
- **No**, the API wasn't created for only Kotlin users, but rather to provide a clean, fluent API that works well in both Java and Kotlin environments.

#### Who is HoloEasy designed for?
- For library and plugin devs.
