# What's next

## Docs needed

As you have seen, a breaking version, `4.0.0`, has been released.
With this version I thought it would be better to also create explanatory and intuitive documentation.

I'm open and would appreciate some PR to improve this book as well.
The code can be found in the `/book` folder of the repo.

There are still parts of the documentation that have not been completed, I will gradually create them over time,
but in the meantime you also have access to the examples of the [holoeasy-example-packetevents](https://github.com/unldenis/holoeasy/tree/master/holoeasy-example-packetevents) and [holoeasy-example-protocollib](https://github.com/unldenis/holoeasy/tree/master/holoeasy-example-protocollib) modules.
